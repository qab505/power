(3/3)
•      Positive rights (claim-rights)

radio stations may be required to provide space or time
for content others wish to hear.

        •   With Caller ID now routine and widely used, it might be
            surprising that when the service was first available, it was very
            controversial because of privacy implications.
        •   What aspect of privacy does Caller ID protect for the recipient of
            the call?
        •   What aspect of privacy does Caller ID violate for the caller?
        •   What are some good reasons why a nonbusiness, noncriminal

            Tailored Customer Service
        Customer service centers use software to analyze a customer's
        words, categorize the customer's personality type, and help
        determine how the service agent can best respond to the customer.

        The system saves information associated with the customer's phone
        number so that on subsequent calls, the system can route the call to
        a service agent with a compatible personality.

        The system, according to one company, helps shorten calls and
        increase positive resolutions for the customer.

            the call is recorded to improve customer service.

            about this use of data about them?

      What is Intellectual Property?
 The intangible creative work, not its particular
  physical form.
    e.g. buying a book vs. buying story, plot etc.
    Can resell, lend, give away but cannot make copies
     (with some exceptions)

 Why does intellectual property require protection?
   Value of intelligence and artistic work comes from
    creativity, ideas, research, skills, labor, non-material
    efforts and attributes the creator provides.

 Protected by copyright, patent law, trademarks and
  trade secrets.
  Corresponding page number:
               Copyrights and Patents
 Copyrights:
   Copyright is a legal concept that defines rights to certain
     kinds of intellectual property.
   It protects creative works such as books, articles, songs,
     artwork, movies software and videos.
   Facts, ideas, concepts, processes, and methods of
     operation are not copyrightable. Only the form or
     manner in which they are expressed is.
   Last a limited time. Then becomes public domain.


 Patents
   Another legal concept that protects intellectual property
   Patents protect inventions
  Corresponding page number:
                    U.S. Copyright Law
 U.S copyright Law (Title 17 of U.S. Code) gives
  copyright holder following exclusive rights:
    To make copies of the work.
    To produce derivative works, such as translations into
     other languages or movies based on books.
    To distribute copies
    To perform the work in public (e.g. music, plays)
    To display the work in public (e.g. artwork, movies,
     computer games, video on a Web site)

Breaking any of these laws will be called copyright
infringement and are subject to civil/criminal penalties.

   Challenges of New Technology
 Digital technology and the Internet make
  copyright infringement easier and cheaper.

    E.g. photocopier vs. digital technology


 Technological factors:
    New compression technologies make copying large files
      (e.g. graphics, video and audio files) feasible.

    Search engines make finding material easier.


    Peer-to-peer technology makes transferring and sharing
      files easier.

  Corresponding page number:
      Challenges of New Technology
 Technological factors: (cont.)
   Broadband connections make transferring files
     easier and enable streaming video.

   Miniaturization of cameras and other
     equipment enable audience members to record
     and transmit events.

   Scanners allow us to change the media of a
     copyrighted work, converting printed text, photos,
     and artwork to electronic form.

   New tools allow us to modify graphics, video and
     audio files to make derivative works.

  Challenges of New Technology
Challenges of New Technology (cont.)
 In the past, generally businesses and professionals
  owned copyrights, and could afford the necessary
  copying and production equipment to infringe
  copyrights.

 Technology and the Internet empowered us all to be
  publishers, and thus to become copyright owners (for
  our blogs and photos, for example), and they
  empowered us all to copy, and thus to infringe
  copyrights.

 Computer software first to face significant threats
  from digital media – software piracy.
  Corresponding page number:
  Question for discussion
 What does it mean to solve the problems of
  technology’s impact on intellectual property
  rights?
    We should recognize that “the problem” looks
     different from different perspectives.

    History of Copyright Laws
A bit of history
 1790 first copyright law passed
 1909 Copyright Act of 1909 defined an unauthorized
  copy as a form that could be seen and read visually.
 1976 and 1980 copyright law revised to include
  software and databases that exhibit "authorship"
  (original expression of ideas), included the "Fair Use
  Doctrine"
 1982 high-volume copying became a felony
 1992 making multiple copies for commercial advantage
  and private gain became a felony



 Corresponding page number:
    History of Copyright Laws
A bit of History (cont.)
 1997 No Electronic Theft Act made it a felony to
  willfully infringe copyright by reproducing or
  distributing one or more copies of copyrighted work
  with a total value of more than $1,000 within a six-
  month period (i.e. the money made during 6 months is
  more than $1,000).
 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
  prohibits making, distributing or using tools to
  circumvent technological copyright protection systems
  and included protection from some copyright lawsuits
  for Web sites where users post material.
 2005 Congress made it a felony to record a movie in a
  movie theater

                      Fair Use Doctrine
   Work allowed to be copied for some purposes such as commentary,
    reviews , search engines, etc and more.
   Four factors considered
     1.   Purpose and nature of use (commercial or nonprofit)? commercial less
          likely to be considered fair use.

     2.   Nature of the copyrighted work. (Novel or creative work less likely to be
          considered fair use. However, factual work is more likely to be considered
          fair use.

     3.   Amount and significance of portion used.

     4.   Effect of use on potential market or value of the copyright work (will it
          reduce sales of work?)

   No single factor alone determines use is fair use.
   Not all factors given equal weight, varies by circumstance

   Ethical arguments about copying
There are many arguments for and against
unauthorized copying:
 For : Copying or distributing a song or computer program
  does not decrease the use and enjoyment any other person
  gets from his or her copy.
 Against : But copying can decrease the amount of money
  that the copyright owner earns.
 For : Copying enables users to try out products, benefiting
  the copyright owner by encouraging sales.
 Against: Businesses and organizations should make their
  own decisions about marketing products, not consumers
  who want free samples.
 Fair use guidelines are useful ethical guidelines.

           The copy was for private, noncommercial use
            and generally was not kept after viewing.
           The movie studios could not demonstrate that
            they suffered any harm.
           The studios had received a substantial fee for
            broadcasting movies on TV, and the fee
            depends on having a large audience who view for
            free.

Trade Secret
• Confidential piece of intellectual property that gives
  company a competitive advantage
• Never expires
• Not appropriate for all intellectual properties
• Reverse engineering allowed
• May be compromised when employees leave firm

Trademark, Service Mark
• Trademark: Identifies goods
• Service mark: Identifies services
• Company can establish a “brand name”
• Does not expire
• If brand name becomes common noun, trademark may be lost
• Companies advertise to protect their trademarks
• Companies also protect trademarks by contacting those who
  misuse them

4.7 Protections for Software




          Copyright © 2020, 2017, 2015 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Software Copyrights
• Copyright protection began 1964
• What gets copyrighted?
   – Expression of idea, not idea itself
   – Object program, not source program
• Companies treat source code as a trade secret




                 Copyright © 2020, 2017, 2015 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Safe Software Development
• Reverse engineering okay
• Companies must protect against unconscious copying
• Solution: “clean room” software development strategy
   – Team 1 analyzes competitor’s program and writes
     specification
   – Team 2 uses specification to develop software

Software Patents (1 of 3)
• Until 1981, Patent Office refused to grant software patents
   – Saw programs as mathematical algorithms, not
     processes or machines
• U.S. Supreme Court decision led to first software patent in
  1981
• Further court rulings led to patents being granted for wider
  range of software

Software Patents (2 of 3)
• Thousands of software patents now exist
   – Microsoft files ~ 3,000 applications annually
   – Licensing patents a source of revenue
• Secondary market for software patents
   – Patent-holding companies (a.k.a. patent trolls):
     Companies that specialize in buying patents and
     enforcing patent rights
   – Based on assumption that companies would rather
     settle out of court than spend time and money going to
     trial
   – RIM didn’t settle quickly; ended up paying $612 million

                 Copyright © 2020, 2017, 2015 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Software Patents (3 of 3)
• Critics say too many patents have been issued
   – Patent Office doesn’t know about prior art, so it issues
      bad software patents
   – Obvious inventions get patents
• Companies with new products fear getting sued for patent
  infringement
    – Build stockpiles of patents as defense mechanism
    – Software patents used as legal weapons

Key Differences between Software
Copyrights and Software Patents

                                                      Software               Software
Blank                                                 Copyright                Patent
What is protected?                                                            Software
                                                  Object Program,           process with
                                                  screen displays          practical utility
Is getting protection expensive?                          No                      Yes
Is getting protection time consuming?                     No                      Yes
Is reverse engineering allowed?                           Yes                     No

4.8 Legitimacy of Intellectual
Property Protection for Software




          Copyright © 2020, 2017, 2015 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Do We Have the Right System in Place?
• Software licenses typically prevent you from making copies
  of software to sell or give away
• Software licenses are legal agreements
• Not discussing morality of breaking the law
• Discussing whether society should give intellectual
  property protection to software




                 Copyright © 2020, 2017, 2015 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Rights-Based Analysis
• “Just deserts” argument
    – Programming is hard work that only a few can do
    – Programmers should be rewarded for their labor
    – They ought to be able to own their programs
• Criticism of “just deserts” argument
   – Why does labor imply ownership?
   – Can imagine a just society in which all labor went to
      common good
   – Intellectual property not like physical property

Argument Why Software Copying Is Bad




The chain of reasoning of a consequentialist argument for why copying software is bad.

                          Copyright © 2020, 2017, 2015 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Utilitarian Analysis
• Argument against copying
   – Copying software reduces software purchases…
   – Leading to less income for software makers…
   – Leading to lower production of new software…
   – Leading to fewer benefits to society
• Each of these claims can be debated
   – Not all who get free copies can afford to buy software
   – Open-source movement demonstrates many people are willing to
     donate their software-writing skills
   – Hardware industry wants to stimulate software industry
   – Difficult to quantify how much society would be harmed if certain
     software packages not released

Summary (1 of 3)
• To stimulate creativity in the arts and technology, governments grant
  limited ownership rights to creators of intellectual property
    – Trade secrets
    – Trademarks/service marks
    – Patents
    – Copyrights
• Goal: Provide creators of IP with rewards while ensuring public has
  access to their creations
• Fair use doctrine an example of trying to find the balance between
  rights of IP holders and the common good
    – Time shifting
    – Space shifting

                     Copyright © 2020, 2017, 2015 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Summary (2 of 3)
• New information technology has put pressure on IP laws
   – Digital representation of audio, video allows perfect copies
   – Broadband Internet allows quick and wide dissemination
   – Pirate Bay a prime example
   – Companies understand they must make “doing the right thing” as
     easy as “doing the wrong thing”
   – Now more convenient to get paid content through NetFlix, Hulu
     Plus, Apple iTunes store
• Intellectual property rights for software
    – Copyright protection less controversial
    – Patent protection highly controversial
    – Alice v. CLS Bank may be a turning point

Summary (3 of 3)
• Open-source movement
   – Alternative to proprietary model of software development
   – Success stories include Linux, Android, Firebox, and OpenOffice
• Creative Commons
   – An effort to create a greater sharing culture in the arts
   – Allows copyright holders to indicate up front the conditions under
      which others can use their work

                     • Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a term used
                       for systems that restrict the use of digital media
                     • DRM defends against the illegal altering, sharing,
                       copying, printing, viewing of digital media
                     • Copyright owners claim DRM is needed to
                       prevent revenue lost from illegal distribution of
                       their copyrighted material

                     • Technically, it is impossible to completely prevent users
                       from copying media they purchase

                     • Most companies realize they cannot stop “professionals”

                       copying

                     • Traditional recording media (e.g., audio tape, VHS tape)
                       for audio and video are analog and used different
                       standards NTSC, PAL, SECAM ...
                     • Piracy is not too big of a concern because quality
                       degrades with each copy generation.
                     • With digital recording and high-resolution video, DVD
                       copy protection was a big issue to the movie industry.
                     • In fact, it took about 2 years after the invention of DVD to
                       put DVD movies on the shelf. Part of it is due to the
                       development of a reasonable copy protection scheme.

                     • DVD region codes are a digital rights
                       management technique introduced in 1997.
                     
                     
                     • It is designed to allow rights holders to control the
                       international distribution of a DVD release, including
                       its content, release date, and price, all according to
                       the appropriate region.
                     
                     
                     • This is achieved by way of region-locked DVD players,
                       which will play back only DVDs encoded to their
                       region (plus those without any region code).

                     • The American DVD Copy Control Association also
                       requires that DVD player manufacturers incorporate
                       the regional-playback control (RPC) system.
                     
                     • However, region-free DVD players, which ignore
                       region coding, are also commercially available, and
                       many DVD players can be modified to be region-free,
                       allowing playback of all discs.

                       Matsushita, Toshiba.
                     • Idea:
                           – Alice sells Bob a video, in order for Alice to
                             prevent Bob from re-disseminating the video to
                             others, Alice tries to make sure that Bob only
                             accesses the video data on a trusted (or
                             compliant) device

                                     Trusted Devices
                     • A trusted device is manufactured by a trusted
                       manufacturer.
                     • A manufacturer is trusted if it has joined the Copy
                       Control Association (CCA)
                     • A trusted device is given a (secret) player key
                     • The trusted manufacturer has to sign an agreement with
                       CCA, basically barring it from making devices that could
                       undermine the copy protection mechanism.
                     • Since 2000, manufacturers must produce DVD ROM
                       drivers compliant with RPC 2 (Region Playback Control)

                          CSS: Content Scrambling System
                     • In most cases, a DVD (video disk) is protected by the CSS scheme. Intuitively,
                       the video content is encrypted using a disc key, k.
                     • In the lead-in area of a CSS-protected DVD, the disk’s key k is encrypted about
                       400 times, each using a different player key.
                     • A DVD player with the ith player key will read the ith entry of the key block. This
                       entry is then decrypted using the player key ki to obtain the disk key k.
                     • The video content is then decrypted on-the-fly while the movie is played.
                     • Using a normal DVD writer the copy will not have the key block and disk will
                       not be playable
                     • if someone decrypts a video, with special tools (HW or SW), it is possible make
                       pirated copies with the lead-in key block or without CSS (i.e., decrypted).

•    Luddites:                Eliminate jobs to reduce cost of production

•    Non-Luddites: Reduce effort needed to produce goods & services.

•    The Same Thing?

•   First suggests massive unemployment, profits for capitalists,
and a poorer life for most workers.

•   Second suggests improvements in wealth and standard of
living.

            Nature and Human Life Styles
•    Luddites argue that technology has made no
important improvements in life.

•    Many debates set up a humans-versus-nature
dichotomy.

•    Is a computing device is “good” by a human-centered
standard, depends on:
• whether it meets our needs,
• how well it does so,
• at what cost,
• how well it compares to alternatives.

Technology
•   Some people do not want to own or use a mobile phone.

•   Technology advocates say if you don’t want one, you don’t have to buy
one.

•   But this is not true. We must have one.

•   Before mobile phones became popular, there were coin-operated
telephones all over, on street corners, in and near stores, in
restaurants, at gas stations, and so on. If we needed to make a call
while away from home or work, we could use a pay phone.

•   Now most pay phones are gone, so we must have a mobile phone
whether we want to or not.

•   Is this an accurate and convincing analysis?

Technology
•   Some writers express concern about a digital divide between content
consumers and content producers on the Internet.

•   Internet users create blogs, Web pages, videos, and product reviews.

•   Being a content creator empowers a user to communicate his or her message
to a large number of people. The Internet can be a strong agent for change for
those who have the skills, education, and tools to create content.

•   Content creators tend to be more educated, and the content-production divide
shows a gap among users based on socioeconomic status.

•   How should we view the Internet content-production divide?

•   Consider comparisons with content production before the Internet.

Digital Watermarking?


Allows users to embed SPECIAL PATTERN or
SOME DATA into digital contents without
changing its perceptual quality.
 When data is embedded, it is not written
at HEADER PART but embedded directly into
digital media itself by changing media
contents data
 Watermarking is a key process for the
PROTECTION of copyright ownership of
electronic data.

Features of Watermarking
 Invisible/Inaudible

 Information is embedded without digital content

degradation, because of the level of embedding
operation is too small for human to notice the
change.

 Inseparable
 The embedded information can survive after some

processing, compression and format transformation.

 Unchanging data file size

 Data size of the media is not changed before and

after embedding operation because information is
embedded directly into the media.

What is "Professional Ethics"?
 Will look at it from a computer professional’s point of view.
Ethical dilemmas related to actions and decision of individuals who
create and use computer systems.
 Professional ethics includes relationships with and responsibilities toward
customers, clients, coworkers, employees, employers etc.

 A professional has a responsibility to act ethically. Many professions have a
code of ethics that professionals are expected to abide by
 Medical doctors
 Lawyers and judges
 Etc.

 Honesty is one of the most fundamental ethical values.
 A lie treats people as merely means to an end, not ends in themselve
Corresponding page number: 404-405

Ethical Guidelines for Computer
Professionals

Special Aspects of Professional Ethics

 First: A professional is an expert in a field

 Most people affected by the devices, systems, and

services of professionals, do not understand how
they work and cannot easily judge their quality and
safety.

 Customers rely on the knowledge, expertise, and

honesty of the professional.

Ethical Guidelines for Computer
Professionals

Special Aspects of Professional Ethics

 Second: The work of many professionals profoundly
affect large numbers of people, some indirectly

 A professional has special responsibilities not just to
customers, but to those indirectly affected. These
responsibilities include thinking about potential risks to
privacy and security of data, safety, reliability, and ease of
use.

 Professionals must maintain up to date skills and
knowledge

 Because of the complexity of computer software,
professionals have an ethical responsibility not simply to
avoid intentional evil, but to exercise a high degree of care
and follow good professional practices to reduce the
likelihood of problems.

Corresponding page number: 405-406

Ethical Guidelines for Computer

Scenario 2: Email System With Targeted Ads

 Your company is developing a free email service that will
include targeted advertising based on the content of the
email messages (similar to Google’s Gmail). You are part
of the team designing the system. What are your ethical
responsibilities?

Corresponding page number: 414-415

Scenarios
Scenario 2: Email System With Targeted Ads
 Protect privacy of email.


Software scan email, reduce privacy threat.
 What will the system store?
 Set of ads displayed to a particular user could provide a lot of
information about the user.
 Should no data be stored ? (some is important)
 Protect records from (hackers, accidental leak,..)
 Telling customers that they will see ads based on the content of
their email (informed consent) is not sufficient if the system stores
data that can link a list of ads with a particular user. You must
explain this to potential users in a privacy policy or user agreement.
 Should the system let users turn off ads completely?
 There is no strong argument that an opt-out option is ethically
obligatory

Scenarios
Scenario 3: Webcams in School Laptops

 As part of your responsibilities, you oversee the
installation of software packages for large orders. A
recent order of laptops for a local school district requires
webcam software to be loaded. You know that this
software allows for remote activation of the webcam.

Corresponding page number: 415-416

Scenarios
Scenario 3: Webcams in School Laptops

 Is it your duty to know how your customers will use a
product that you supply? Should you inform them, caution
them, even require them to take measures to protect the
people who will use the product?
 Consider that the school district might not even be familiar
with the workings of the software package they ordered.
 Dishonest employees activates cameras and eavesdrops
 Trust between family and school, and between you and your
customer will evaporate.
 the most challenging questions for anyone doing business is
to whom am I responsible?
Corresponding page number: 415-416

Scenarios
Scenario 3: Webcams in School Laptops

 The most obvious answer is the paying customer – in
this case, the school district. But as the ACM Code
points out, our responsibilities go beyond customers, to
employers, users and the public.
 Your company is ethically responsible for informing
your customers of the risks of a product it sell.
(whether the company or third party designed it)
 Suggest solutions or alternatives.
 They might turn down proposal.

Scenarios
Scenario 5: Specifications

 You are a relatively junior programmer working on
modules that collect data from loan application forms
and convert them to formats required by the parts of the
program that evaluate the applications. You find that
some demographic data are missing from some forms,
particularly race and age. What should your program do?
What should you do?

Corresponding page number: 417-418

Scenarios
Scenario 5: Specifications

 Consult the specifications for the program.


Your company has an ethical and business obligation to ensure
that the specifications are complete and to produce a program
that meets them.

 If you do not find anything in the specs that covers your
problem. bring the problem to the attention to your manager.


If the manager tells you “just make it” You shouldn’t accept .

 Any changes to specifications must be made in consultation
with the client. Decisions about how a program handles
unusual situations might have serious consequences. (SE code
3.11)


Data on race might be used to ensure compliance with non
discrimination.
 Module might be reused in a drug research study (drugs affect
people in different ethnic groups)

 All changes to specifications must be documented.

Scenarios

Scenario 7: Schedule Pressures – Product to market

 You are a programmer working for a very small start-up
company.
 The company is now developing a truly innovative new
product.
 The target release date is nine months away.
 The bulk of the programming and testing is done.
 You are about to begin the beta testing.
 The owner of the company (who is not a programmer)
decide to skip the beta testing and start making plans for an
early release. (within two months)

Corresponding page number: 420-421

Scenarios
Scenario 7: Schedule Pressures – Product to market
 Should you say nothing ? Should you speak up? Or quit ?

 You might be the only one who recognizes the problem or
understands a particular situation.
 Your responsibilities to your company include applying your
knowledge and skill to help avoid a bad decision. (SE 2.06
and 3.09)

Corresponding page number: 420-421

Scenarios
Scenario 9: Going Public

 Suppose you are a member of a team working on a
computer-controlled crash avoidance system for
automobiles. You think the system has a flaw that could
endanger people. The project manager does not seem
concerned and expects to announce completion of the
project soon. Do you have an ethical obligation to do
something?

Corresponding page number: 422-423

Scenarios
Scenario 9: Going Public

 you do have an ethical obligation to do something.
 First, discuss your concerns with the project manager.
 If the manager decides to proceed, next option is to go to
someone higher up in the company.
 If no one with authority in the company is willing to
investigate your concerns.
 You now have the option of going outside ex: government
agency.
 You must consider whether you are confident that you have
the expertise to assess the risk. Mistaken public
whistleblowing can itself cause serious harm. It might help to
discuss the problem with other professionals.

• Galaxy IV (Telecom Satellite)

• When a Galaxy IV satellite computer failed, many

systems stopped working.
• Pager service stopped for an estimated 85% of users in
the U.S., including hospitals and police departments.
• Airlines that got their weather information from the
satellite had to delay flights.
• Gas stations of a major chain could not verify credit
cards.
• Some services were quickly switched to other satellites
or backup systems. It took days to restore others.
• Amtrak (The National Railroad Passenger Corporation)
• A failure of Amtrak’s reservation and ticketing system
during Thanksgiving weekend caused delays because
agents had no printed schedules or fare lists.

367-369

System Failures: Some causes

 Lack of clear, well-thought-out goals and specifications.
 Poor management and poor communication among
customers, designers, programmers, etc.
 Institutional and political pressures that encourage
unrealistically low bids, low budget requests, and
underestimates of time requirements.
 Use of very new technology, with unknown reliability
and problems
 Refusal to recognize or admit a project is in trouble.

What Goes Wrong?

 Two reasons:
 The job they are doing is inherently difficult.
 Computer systems interact with the real world. They
often include complex communication networks, have
numerous features, have interconnected subsystems,
and extremely large.
 Computer software is “nonlinear”

 a small error in a mechanical system might cause a

small degradation in performance,
 a single typo in a computer program can cause a
dramatic difference in behavior.


Sometimes the job is done poorly.
 The job can be done poorly at any of many stages, from
system design and implementation to system
management and use.

Therac-25 Radiation Overdoses

 Massive overdoses of radiation were given; the machine said
no dose had been administered at all
 Caused severe and painful injuries and the death of three
patients
 Important to study to avoid repeating errors.
 Manufacturer, computer programmer, and hospitals/clinics
all have some responsibility

Why So Many Incidents?

 Hospitals had never seen such massive overdoses before,
were unsure of the cause.
 Manufacturer said the machine could not have caused the
overdoses and no other incidents had been reported (which
was untrue)
 The manufacturer made changes to the turntable and
claimed they had improved safety after the second accident.
The changes did not correct any of the causes identified later.

380-383

Why So Many Incidents? (cont.)

 Recommendations were made for further changes to
enhance safety; the manufacturer did not implement
them.
 The FDA declared the machine defective after the fifth
accident.
 The sixth accident occurred while the FDA was negotiating
with the manufacturer on what changes were needed.

Observations and Perspective

 Minor design and implementation errors usually occur in
complex systems; they are to be expected.
 The problems in the Therac-25 case were not minor and
suggest irresponsibility.
 Accidents occurred on other radiation treatment equipment
without computer controls when the technicians:
 Left a patient after treatment started to attend a party.
 Did not properly measure the radioactive drugs.
 Confused micro-curies and milli-curies.

SUSTAINABILITY

OUTLINE
• What is sustainability?
• Why should we care?
• Green IT.
• Sustainability in business.
• Software sustainability.
• Sustainability’s dimensions.
• Guidelines for incorporating sustainability into software design.

WHAT IS SUSTAINABILITY
• Sustainability is characterized by the United Nations as “development that
meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs.“
• This includes decision-making that takes into consideration financial, social,
and environmental risks, obligations and opportunities.
• Sustainable businesses are resilient and create economic value, healthy
ecosystems and strong communities.
• Sustainability refer also to electronic waste management and the ecological
impacts of recycling the drastically increasing amount of computing gear.

WHY SHOULD WE CARE?
• It is forecasted that by 2021, 28
billion devices will be connected
to each other which will increase
energy consumption drastically.
• The Information and
Communications Technology
(ICT) sector contributes around 2%
of the global CO2 emissions.
• It is also accountable for
approximately 8% of the EU’s
electricity consumption.

GREEN IT
• The initiatives that foster respect for the environment by means of
ICT, IT, software, etc., are called Green or Greening
ICT/IT/Software or sometimes sustainability in IT.
• Green IT is not only a trend; it is becoming a necessity as more and
more organisations are implementing some form of sustainable
solutions.
• Green IT initiatives can range from those that focus on reducing IT
infrastructure’s carbon footprint to those that transform a business.

GREEN IN IT VERSUS GREEN BY IT
• IT can contribute to sustainability from two perspectives:
• Green IT (Green in IT): when IT itself has an impact on the environment.
• Green by IT: when IT provides tools for making tasks environment
friendly.

• When the goal pursued is to reduce the energy consumption and
the resources used by IT, we are talking about Green in IT.
• When the focus is on using IT to achieve more environmentfriendly systems in other domains, then this is Green by IT.

SUSTAINABILITY IN BUSINESS
• Sustainability has become more and more important to business recently.
• A business that fails to have sustainable development as one of its top priorities
could receive considerable public criticism and subsequently lose market
legitimacy.
• Organisations have begun to redesign their business models on the basis of
sustainability, treating sustainable development as a new source of innovation, a new
opportunity for cutting costs and a new mechanism for gaining competitive advantage.
• Investors and other stakeholders consider companies in terms of the ‘triple bottom
line’, reflecting financial performance, environmental practices and corporate social
responsibility.

SOFTWARE SUSTAINABILITY
• Sustainable software is ‘software, which impacts on economy, society, human
beings, and environment that result from development, deployment, and usage of the
software are minimal and/or which have a positive effect on sustainable development
• Software plays a major role, both as part of the problem and as part of the solution.
• The way to achieve sustainable software is by improving power consumption.
• The behaviour of the software has significant influence on whether the energysaving features built into the hardware are effective.
• Sustainable software is energy-efficient, minimizes the environmental impact of the
processes it supports, and has a positive impact on social and/or economic
sustainability.

GREEN IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
• Software engineering can be green in three ways:
1. By producing green software.
2. By producing software to support environmental consciousness (green
by software).
3. By producing less waste during the development process.

SUSTAINABILITY’S DIMENSIONS
• Sustainability has five dimensions:
• Individual sustainability: maintenance of the good of an individual regarding
health, education, skills, knowledge and leadership.
• Social sustainability: maintenance of relationships between individuals and groups.
• Economic sustainability: covers financial aspects and business value.
• Environmental sustainability: protecting natural resources such as water, land,
air, minerals and ecosystem services.
• Technical sustainability: It has the central objective of long-time usage of systems
and their adequate evolution with changing surrounding conditions and respective
requirements.

SUSTAINABILITY’S DIMENSIONS
• Questions to be asked:
• Individual sustainability: ‘How can software be created and maintained in a way that
enables developers to be satisfied with their job over a long period of time?’
• Social sustainability: ‘What effects do software systems have on society (e.g.
communication, interaction, government)?’
• Economic sustainability: ‘How can software systems be created so that the
stakeholders’ long-term investments are as safe as possible from economic risks?’
• Environmental sustainability: ‘How does software affect the environment during
development and maintenance?’
• Technical sustainability: ‘How can software be created so that it can easily adapt to
future change?’

SUSTAINABILITY’S DIMENSIONS
• Example: smart home
• Individual: provide user friendly solution for home users with easy to use user
interface and information to induce sustainable behaviour among users.
• Social: encourage users to form communities to share data as a way of
encouraging each other to be energy conscious and environmentally aware of the
consequences of their actions and inaction while using smart home solutions.
• Economic: reduce household cost on energy.
• Environment: reduce household energy consumption.
• Technical: provide good security for user personal data and avoid technical glitch
that could lead to high energy usage.

CONCLUSION
• Global climate change is one of the most pressing problems of our
time. Government agencies, universities, and businesses are starting to
step up and invest in research, but even more change is needed,
ranging from standards and policies to research innovations
and new businesses. Now is the time for computer scientists to
use their skills and resources to help create an energy-efficient
future.
